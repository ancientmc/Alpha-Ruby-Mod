This is an example mod in Risugami's ModLoader for Minecraft Alpha 1.2.6, built in the [Ancient Coder Pack](https://github.com/ancientmc/AncientCoderPack/blob/0.2.x-beta/build.gradle).

This serves as a way for developers to gain an understanding of how to use this ModLoader, which otherwise has little documentation online. Comments are included about how to do various things in it. Note that this is an older version 

Along with that, a ZIP file is also included. This mod has been able to run successfully on Prism (and therefore should work with other MultiMC variants), but Betacraft has been proving to be a bit trickier. 

To download Risugami's Modloader for Alpha 1.2.6, go to [this link](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader?gvsn=). Scroll down to find Alpha 1.2.6. 

More will be added eventually.
